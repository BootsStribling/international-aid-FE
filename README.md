# See-Suite - Team 2 International Aid Hackathon Application (05.03.2022 to 05.05.2022)

## ABOUT
This project was constructed as part of an General Assembly Hackathon for an international aid organization called Unlocking Communities. Unlocking Communities is an organization that "...equips entrepreneurs with the education and tools to sell sustainable products that unlock economic, social, and environmental transformation in their communities." More information about Unlocking Communities can be found [here.](https://unlockingcommunities.org/our-mission/)

The Hackathon parameters were to create an application with at least one feature that tracked some potion of the entrepreneur sales or inventory and represent that data to both C-level executives and local entrepreneur managers in low-bandwidth areas of the world. From an engineering standpoint, we created this coupled application to handle data received by other teams' applications, namely Team 1 - (Android Application Development Team), and represent that data as a tracking software to indicate which communties and entrepreneurs needed additional training and support.

## V2 Expectations
  This project, along with the other 4 teams who participated, was handed to Deloitte as a prototype for them to build the working application with. While we do not know the status of that application, we certainly hope that our time and code was used effectively to the aid of those in the countries it was deployed in.
